This program asks for your user, domain, and password to enable auto logon after backing up the registry. It then clicks through all the windows updates until there is no more button or it gets an error. It will reboot and rerun as required. When its finished, you get a message stating the outcome. It thinks there are no more updates, or it failed and rebooting didn't work.

Hopefully you find this helpful! This was one of those things that I wanted to write a long time ago but didn't know how, and then when I did I didn't have a need for it. Recently was reminded of it and decide to give it a shot. This was written pretty quickly so if you find bugs feel free to fix 'em.


If this isn't working or it is asking you for permission constantly its worth noting I used AutoIt Script Editor. to compile it. Not the light version that is included in the package. You could fix this by adding #requireadmin. I choose not to.
